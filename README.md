## Intro
### Why?
Insiders know how well their company works. If insider is buying back
their stock, then they are confident. Insider transaction are availble in both [NSE](https://www.nseindia.com/companies-listing/corporate-filings-insider-trading) and BSE. Issue with this data is that, it shows every transaction. All we want is comprehensive view,
is they buying or selling? 
### Solution
For each timeframe (week, month, year), get the total buying and selling of the stock by insider and rank it by difference. Tada, now
you get a comprehensive view.

## TODO
- [ ] Automate the updation of data
- [ ] currently sorting based on difference in amount of total buy/sell, add other meaningful factors to sort
- [ ] show more stocks, along with other info?
- [ ] Export data?
